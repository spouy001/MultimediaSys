        <p>The sift package contains classes needed for wrapping and accessing the 
        sift binary.</p>

        <p>The binary itself is NOT included in this library as it is incompatible 
        with the licence. In order to use the SIFT algorithm, the binary has
        to be obtained from <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/">the website</a>.
        Also, the path to the executable should be entered in the 
        <code>jfeaturelib.properties</code> file.</p>

        <p>The classes of this package should NOT be used directly except from the 
        according classes in the <code>de.lmu.dbs.jfeaturelib.features</code> package.</p>
